# Payroll 

## Overview 

### This is a Java code, named PayCalculator. It's a program for computing payroll details for employees. It demonstrates the candidate's ability to handle user input, perform calculations, and generate a formatted output. The code collects information from the user, such as the name, pay rate, and hours worked. It also accomodates both regular and overtime hours when calculating the gross pay. To try to make it legit I included the different tax rate deductions (federal, state, medicare, social security, and unemployment.) Once ran, the payroll sumary will display the pay rate, hours worked, gross pay, total deductions, and net pay. I added the programmer details just for extra information from the user adding everyone's information if it were a corporate setting.
